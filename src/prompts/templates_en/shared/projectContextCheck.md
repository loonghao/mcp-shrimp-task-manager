**ðŸš¨ MANDATORY FIRST STEP:**

Before proceeding with any task, you MUST call `get_project_context` to:

1. **Confirm Current Working Directory**: Ensure you're working with the correct project
2. **Verify Data Storage Paths**: Confirm where tasks, memory, and logs are stored
3. **Check Project Detection**: Validate that the system detected the right project

**Expected Output Structure:**
```
$DATA_DIR/projects/$PROJECT_NAME/
â”œâ”€â”€ tasks.json     # Your tasks will be stored here
â”œâ”€â”€ memory/        # AI memory and context
â”œâ”€â”€ logs/          # Project-specific logs
â””â”€â”€ config/        # Project configuration
```

**If the detected project is wrong:**
- Use `set_project_working_directory` to correct the path
- Provide the absolute path to the correct project directory
- Set `persistent: true` to save the configuration

**This ensures:**
- Tasks are saved in the correct project directory
- Memory and context are project-specific
- All data is properly organized and accessible
